# CleanStreets

A step todawards Go Green, Digitalization and Eco Friendly.

Problem?
Garbage dump in neighbourhoods has been a critical issue among developing countries. This makes the residency unhygience.

Although it is an individual's responsibility to not dump garbage careless, the least they can do is to notify the officials about it.

This apps acts as a platform between the user and their municipal coorporation.
A user can snap a picture of any inconvenience like a garbage dump or pot holes near them and post it as a request. The application tags the request with location coordinates so the user doesnt have to input address.

Snap a picture and post it just like on any social media. Effortless.
